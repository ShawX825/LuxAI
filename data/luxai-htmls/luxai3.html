In the event a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the Submission that received the next highest score rank will be chosen as the potential winner.\n\n#### **10.\tNOTIFICATION OF WINNERS \u0026 DISQUALIFICATION.**\n\nThe potential winner(s) will be notified by email. \n \nIf a potential winner (i) does not respond to the notification attempt within one (1) week from the first notification attempt or (ii) notifies Kaggle within one week after the Final Submission Deadline that the potential winner does not want to be nominated as a winner or does not want to receive a Prize, then, in each case (i) and (ii) such potential winner will not receive any Prize, and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the Competition’s judging criteria.\n \nIn case (i) and (ii) above Kaggle may disqualify the participant.  However, in case (ii) above, if requested by Kaggle, such potential winner may provide code and documentation to verify the participant’s compliance with these Rules. If the potential winner provides code and documentation to the satisfaction of Kaggle, the participant will not be disqualified pursuant to this paragraph.\n \nCompetition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any participant from the Competition if the Competition Sponsor reasonably believes that the participant has attempted to undermine the legitimate operation of the Competition by cheating, deception, or other unfair playing practices or abuses, threatens or harasses any other participants, Competition Sponsor or Kaggle.\n \nA disqualified participant may be removed from the Competition leaderboard, at Kaggle\u0027s sole discretion. If a Participant is removed from the Competition Leaderboard, additional winning features associated with the Kaggle competition platform, for example Kaggle points or medals, may also not be awarded.\n \nThe final leaderboard list will be publicly displayed at Kaggle.com. Determinations of Competition Sponsor are final and binding.\n\n#### **11.\tWINNERS OBLIGATIONS.**\n\nAs a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:\n\n(a) deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model\u0027s software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow [these documentation guidelines][5], must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. To the extent that the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission;\n\n(b) grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license; \n\n(c) sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (i) eligibility certifications; (ii) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (iii) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).\n\n#### **12.\tPRIZES.**&nbsp;\n\nPrize(s) are as described on the Competition Website and are only available for winning during the time period described on the Competition Website. The odds of winning any Prize depends on the number of eligible Submissions received during the Competition Period and the skill of the participants. \n\nAll Prizes are subject to Competition Sponsor\u0027s review and verification of the participant’s eligibility and compliance with these Rules, and the compliance of the winning Submissions with the Submissions Requirements. In the event that the Submission demonstrates non-compliance with these Competition Rules, Competition Sponsor may at its discretion take either of the following actions: (i) disqualify the Submission(s); or (ii) require the potential winner to remediate within one week after notice all issues identified in the Submission(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution of license conflicts, the fulfillment of all obligations required by software licenses, and the removal of any software that violates the software restrictions).\n\nA potential winner may decline to be nominated as a Competition winner in accordance with Section 10.\n\nPotential winners must return all required Prize acceptance documents within two (2) weeks following notification of such required documents, or such potential winner will be deemed to have forfeited the prize and another potential winner will be selected. Prize(s) will be awarded within approximately 30 days after receipt by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle of the required Prize acceptance documents. Transfer or assignment of a Prize is not allowed. \n\nYou are not eligible to receive any Prize if you do not meet the Eligibility requirements in Section 2 above.\n\nIf a Team wins a monetary Prize, the Prize money will be allocated in even shares between the eligible Team members, unless the Team unanimously opts for a different Prize split and notifies Kaggle before Prizes are issued.\n\n#### **13.\tTAXES.** \n\nALL TAXES IMPOSED ON PRIZES ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE WINNERS. Payments to potential winners are subject to the express requirement that they submit all documentation requested by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle for compliance with applicable state, federal, local and foreign (including provincial) tax reporting and withholding requirements. Prizes will be net of any taxes that Competition Sponsor is required by law to withhold. If a potential winner fails to provide any required documentation or comply with applicable laws, the Prize may be forfeited and Competition Sponsor may select an alternative potential winner. Any winners who are U.S. residents will receive an IRS Form-1099 in the amount of their Prize.\n\n#### **14.\tGENERAL CONDITIONS.**&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nAll federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations apply.   \n\n#### **15.\tPUBLICITY.**\n\nYou agree that Competition Sponsor, Kaggle and its affiliates may use your name and likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without additional compensation, unless prohibited by law.\n\n#### **16.\tPRIVACY.**\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that Competition Sponsor and Kaggle may collect, store, share and otherwise use personally identifiable information provided by you during the Kaggle account registration process and the Competition, including but not limited to, name, mailing address, phone number, and email address (“Personal Information”).

Each submission will play Episodes (games) against other bots on the ladder that have a similar skill rating. Over time skill ratings will go up with wins or down with losses and evened out with ties. \n\nEvery bot submitted will continue to play episodes until the end of the competition, with newer bots playing a much more frequent number of episodes. On the leaderboard only your best scoring bot will be shown, but you can track the progress of all of your submissions on your Submissions page.\n\nEach Submission has an estimated Skill Rating which is modeled by a Gaussian N(μ,σ2) where μ is the estimated skill and σ represents the uncertainty of that estimate which will decrease over time.\n\nWhen you upload a Submission, we first play a Validation Episode where that Submission plays against copies of itself to make sure it works properly. If the Episode fails, the Submission is marked as Error and you can download the agent logs to help figure out why. Otherwise, we initialize the Submission with μ0=600 and it joins the pool of All Submissions for ongoing evaluation.\n\nWe repeatedly run Episodes from the pool of All Submissions, and try to pick Submissions with similar ratings for fair matches. Newly submitted agents will be given an increased rate in the number of episodes run to give you faster feedback.\n\nAfter an Episode finishes, we\u0027ll update the Rating estimate for all Submissions in that Episode. If one Submission won, we\u0027ll increase its μ and decrease its opponent\u0027s μ -- if the result was a draw, then we\u0027ll move the two μ values closer towards their mean. The updates will have magnitude relative to the deviation from the expected result based on the previous μ values, and also relative to each Submission\u0027s uncertainty σ. We also reduce the σ terms relative to the amount of information gained by the result. The score by which your bot wins or loses an Episode does not affect the skill rating updates.\n\nAt the submission deadline, additional submissions will be locked. Your team will be allowed to submit up to 2 bots for the final evaluation and rankings. A week\u0027s worth of time will be allotted to continue to run games. At the conclusion of time, the leaderboard is final.\n\n## Ranking System\nAfter an Episode finishes, we\u0027ll update the Rating estimate for all Submissions in that Episode.

This award will be given out to the competitor who develops the most innovative, creative strategy and writeup. We will give out honorable mentions to at most 4 submissions if they also have really great strategies and write ups but were just edged out by the winner. \n \nTo be considered for this award, please fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/o82vymAYQMPyLN9r8). Your submission will be judged by the Lux AI Challenge team.\n \nWe will be evaluating write ups on the following factors\n \n- Innovation: We\u0027re looking for strategies that were unique to this competition and would easily be something you couldn\u0027t figure out just by reading the Kaggle Forums or our Discord or Googling online. For this factor, we weigh uniqueness, novelty, and it\u0027s strategic strength in the competition. This is the highest weighted factor\n \n- Writing Quality: We want to encourage competitors to learn from each other and good writing goes a long way to helping other competitors understand your strategy and work! This is the second highest weighted factor\n \n- Visual Quality: Visuals really help people learn visually what is going on and we will be looking for write ups that make great use of visuals to aid in comprehension. (Doesn\u0027t have to be high quality art, just needs to be understandable). This is the least weighted factor.\n \nTo be eligible for this award, you must submit a document with a maximum of 3 pages in English or Chinese. You are free to structure your write up however you see works best! Please do not cram text, we recommend sticking to 11 point font as a default.\n \nThe deadline to make a submission is December 16th 11:59PM UTC. Late submissions will not be considered under any circumstances. You may edit your submission any time before the deadline. By creating a submission, you accept that your submission and Kaggle Username may be shared to the public.\n \n### QuantCo Top Performance Award\n \nQuantCo will be giving out the QuantCo Top Performance Award, which is awarded to the best 10 individual competitors (single member teams) and the best 10 teams (multiple member teams) in the competition based on the final results.\n \nQuantCo will potentially also be giving out additional informal awards/prizes, please stay tuned on the Kaggle forums and community discord for what these might be.\n\n## Lux AI Challenge Sprint Award\nAt the end of each month of active competition, the top 2 on the leaderboard will receive the **Lux AI Challenge Sprint award** for developing strong bots early on! This award can only be won once per team and if a team in the top 2 has already won the Sprint award, it will be given to the next highest ranking team who has not won the award. All teams are automatically entered into this competition.\n \nIn addition to the Sprint Award, teams will also be awarded competition t-shirts in addition to potential swag from our sponsors as well.\n \nTo pick the top 2 on the leaderboard, we will check the state of the leaderboard at 11:59PM UTC on the last day of each month.

To get started developing a bot, see our [Github](https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-2021)\n\n## Background\n\nThe night is dark and full of terrors. Two teams must fight off the darkness, collect resources, and advance through the ages. Daytime finds a desperate rush to gather and build the resources that can carry you through the impending night. Plan and expand carefully -- any city that fails to produce enough light will be consumed by darkness.\n\n## Environment\n\nIn the Lux AI Challenge Season 1, two competing teams control a team of Units and CityTiles that collect resources to fuel their Cities, with the main objective to own as many CityTiles as possible at the end of the turn-based game. Both teams have complete information about the entire game state and will need to make use of that information to optimize resource collection, compete for scarce resources against the opponent, and build cities to gain points.\n\nEach competitor must program their own agent in their language of choice. Each turn, your agent gets 3 seconds to submit their actions, excess time is not saved across turns. In each game, you are given a pool of 60 seconds that is tapped into each time you go over a turn\u0027s 3-second limit. Upon using up all 60 seconds and going over the 3-second limit, your agent freezes and can no longer submit additional actions.\n\nThe rest of the document will go through the key features of this game.\n\n## The Map\n\nThe world of Lux is represented as a 2d grid. Coordinates increase east (right) and south (down). The map is always a square and can be 12, 16, 24, or 32 tiles long. The (0, 0) coordinate is at the top left.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-2021/master/assets/game_board.png)\n\nThe map has various features including Resources (Wood, Coal, Uranium), Units (Workers, Carts), CityTiles, and Road.\n\nIn order to prevent maps from favoring one player over another, it is guaranteed that maps are always symmetric by vertical or horizontal reflection.\n\nEach player will start with a single CityTile and a single worker on that CityTile\n\n## Resources\n\nThere are 3 kinds of resources: Wood, Coal, and Uranium (in order of increasing fuel efficiency). These resources are collected by workers, then dropped off once a worker moves on top of a CityTile to then be converted into fuel for the city. Some resources require research points before they are possible to collect.\n\nWood in particular can regrow. Each turn, every wood tile\u0027s wood amount increases by 2.5% of its current wood amount rounded up. Wood tiles that have been depleted will not regrow.

E.g. worker with 60 wood adjacent to 3 wood tiles asks for 14 from each, receives 40 wood, and wastes 2.\n  - All tiles of the current iterated resource then try to fulfill requests, if they can\u0027t they make sure all unfulfilled requests get an equal amount, the leftover is wasted. E.g. if 4 workers are mining a tile of 25 wood, but one of them is only asking for 5 while the others are asking for 20 wood each, then first all workers get 5 wood each, leaving 5 wood left over for 3 more workers with space left. This can evenly be distributed by giving 1 wood each to the last 3 workers, leaving 2 wood left that is then wasted.\n\nWorkers cannot mine while on CityTiles. Instead, if there is at least one Worker on a CityTile, that CityTile will automatically collect adjacent resources at the same rate as a worker each turn and directly convert it all to fuel. The collection mechanic for a CityTile is the same as a worker and you can treat a CityTile as an individual Worker collecting resources.\n\n## Actions\n\nUnits and CityTiles can perform actions each turn given certain conditions. In general, all actions are simultaneously applied and are validated against the state of the game at the start of a turn. The next few sections describe the Units and CityTiles in detail.\n\n## CityTiles\n\nA CityTile is a building that takes up one tile of space. Adjacent CityTiles collectively form a City. Each CityTile can perform a single action provided the CityTile has a Cooldown \u0026lt; 1.\n\nActions\n\n- Build Worker - Build Worker unit on top of this CityTile (cannot build a worker if the current number of owned workers + carts equals the number of owned CityTiles)\n- Build Cart - Build Carts unit on top of this CityTile (cannot build a cart if the current number of owned workers + carts equals the number of owned CityTiles)\n- Research - Increase your team’s Research Points by 1\n\n## Units\n\nThere are two unit types, Workers, and Carts. Every unit can perform a single action once they have a Cooldown \u0026lt; 1.\n\nAll units can choose the move action and move in any of 5 directions, North, East, South, West, Center. Moreover, all units can carry raw resources gained from automatic mining or resource transfer. Workers are capped at 100 units of resources and Carts are capped at 2000 units of resources.\n\nWhenever a unit moves on top of a friendly CityTile, the City that CityTile forms converts all carried resources into fuel.\n\nThere can be at most one unit on tiles without a CityTile. Moreover, units cannot move on top of the opposing team’s CityTiles. However, units can stack on top of each other on a friendly CityTile.\n\nIf two units attempt to move to the same tile that is not a CityTile, this is considered a collision, and the move action is canceled.\n\n### Workers\n\nActions\n\n- Move - Move the unit in one of 5 directions, North, East, South, West, Center.\n- Pillage - Reduce the Road level of the tile the unit is on by 0.5\n- Transfer - Send any amount of a single resource-type from a unit\u0027s cargo to another (start-of-turn) adjacent Unit, up to the latter\u0027s cargo capacity. Excess is returned to the original unit.\n- Build CityTile - Build a CityTile right under this worker provided the worker has 100 total resources of any type in their cargo (full cargo) and the tile is empty. If building is successful, all carried resources are consumed and a new CityTile is built with 0 starting resources.\n\n### Carts\n\nActions\n\n- Move - Move the unit in one of 5 directions, North, East, South, West, Center.\n- Transfer - Send any amount of a single resource-type from a unit\u0027s cargo to another (start-of-turn) adjacent Unit, up to the latter\u0027s cargo capacity. Excess is returned to the original unit.\n\n## Cooldown\n\nCityTiles, Workers and Carts all have a cooldown mechanic after each action. Units and CityTiles can only perform an action when they have \u0026lt; 1 Cooldown.\n\nAt the **end of each turn**, after Road have been built and pillaged, each unit\u0027s Cooldown decreases by 1 and further decreases by the level of the Road the unit is on at the end of the turn. CityTiles are not affected by road levels and cooldown always decreases by 1. The minimum Cooldown is 0.\n\nAfter an action is performed, the unit’s Cooldown will increase by a Base Cooldown.\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eUnit Type\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eBase Cooldown\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eCityTile\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e10\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eWorker\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e2\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eCart\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e3\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n## Roads\n\nAs Carts travel across the map, they start to create roads that allow all Units to move faster (see Cooldown). At the end of each turn, Cart will upgrade the road level of the tile it ends on by 0.75. The higher the road level, the faster Units can move and perform actions. All tiles start with a road level of 0 and are capped at 6.\n\nMoreover, CityTiles automatically have the max road level of 6.\n\nRoads can also be destroyed by Workers via the pillage action which reduces road level by 0.5 each time.\n\nIf a City is consumed by darkness, the road level of all tiles in the City\u0027s CityTiles will go back to 0.\n\n## Day/Night Cycle\n\nThe Day/Night cycle consists of a 40 turn cycle, the first 30 turns being day turns, the last 10 being night turns. There are a total of 360 turns in a match, forming 9 cycles.\n\nDuring the night, Units and Cities need to produce light to survive. Each turn of night, each Unit and CityTile will consume an amount of fuel, see table below for rates. Units in particular will use their carried resources to produce light whereas CityTiles will use their fuel to produce light.\n\nWorkers and Carts will only need to consume resources if they are not on a CityTile. When outside the City, Workers and Carts must consume whole units of resources to satisfy their night needs, e.g. if a worker carries 1 wood and 5 uranium on them, they will consume a full wood for 1 fuel, then a full unit of uranium to fulfill the last 3 fuel requirements, wasting 37 fuel. Units will always consume the least efficient resources first.\n\nLastly, at night, Units gain 2x more Base Cooldown\n\nShould any Unit during the night run out of fuel, they will be removed from the game and disappear into the night forever. Should a City run out of fuel, however, the entire City with all of the CityTiles it owns will fall into darkness and be removed from the game.\n\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eUnit\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eFuel Burn in City\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eFuel Burn Outside City\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eCityTile\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e23 - 5 * number of adjacent friendly CityTiles\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eN/A\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eCart\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e0\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e10\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003ctr\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003eWorker\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e0\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n   \u003ctd\u003e4\n   \u003c/td\u003e\n  \u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\n## Game Resolution order\n\nTo help avoid confusion over smaller details of how each turn is resolved, we provide the game resolution order here and how actions are applied.\n\nActions in the game are first all validated against the current game state to see if they are valid. Then the actions, along with game events, are resolved in the following order and simultaneously within each step\n\n1. CityTile actions along with increased cooldown\n2. Unit actions along with increased cooldown\n3. Roads are created\n4. Resource collection\n5. Resource drops on CityTiles\n6. If night time, make Units consume resources and CityTiles consume fuel\n7. Regrow wood tiles that are not depleted to 0\n8. Cooldowns are handled / computed for each unit and CityTile\n\nThe only exception to the validation criteria is that units may move smoothly between spaces, meaning if two units are adjacent, they can swap places in one turn. \n\nOtherwise, actions such as one unit building a CityTile, then another unit moving on top of the new CityTile, are not allowed as the current state does not have this newly built city and units cannot move on top of other units outside of CityTiles.\n\n## Win Conditions\n\nAfter 360 turns the winner is whichever team has the most CityTiles on the map. If that is a tie, then whichever team has the most units owned on the board wins. If still a tie, the game is marked as a tie.\n\nA game may end early if a team no longer has any more Units or CityTiles. Then the other team wins.\n\n## Note on Game Rule Changes \n(This is also in the [competition rules](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021/rules))\n\nOur team at the Lux AI Challenge reserves the right to make any changes on game rules during the course of the competition.
